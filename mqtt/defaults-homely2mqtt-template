# For Home Assistant set both MQTT_DISCOVERY and MQTT_STATE to "homeassistant"
# Some MQTT implementation uses "hass/status" for the state topic prefix
#
MQTT_DISCOVERY="homeassistant"
MQTT_STATE="homeassistant" 
# 
# For Domoticz, you may want to set a "MQTT Auto Discovery Client Gateway with LAN interface" with "homely_ad" as the 
# auto discovery prefix. The MQTT_STATE just has to  be something different
# The domoticzurl is used to set the Domoticz alarm state directly. This uses the Domoticz API directly.
# There is no username/password support, so it is recommended to run this service at the same host as Domoticz
